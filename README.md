# ♟️ Chessify Protocol

A **live, mainnet, free-to-play, multi-chain chess protocol** deployed on **Stacks (Bitcoin L2)**, **Celo (EVM)**, and **Base (EVM)**. 

Chessify lets players wager free-to-mint CHESS tokens on real chess matches: rules are validated **off-chain** (chess.js over a signed Redis move relay) while wagers, payouts, and Elo are **settled on-chain**, all behind a premium "Cyber-Industrial" design system.

> **Chessify vs. [playchessify](https://github.com/jadonamite/playchessify)**: Chessify is the complete multi-chain protocol (Stacks + Celo + Base); playchessify is the Celo-only deployment of the same engine.

## 📐 Architecture Overview

The protocol has been consolidated from a legacy modular system into a streamlined **2-contract architecture** per chain, ensuring lower gas costs and faster execution.

### Stacks (Clarity)
- **`chess-token-v3.clar`**: SIP-010 token + Escrow Vault.
- **`chess-game.clar`**: Game engine, Elo rating system, and Timeout management.
- **`automata-agent.clar`**: On-chain attestation for AI agent actions.

### Celo (Solidity)
- **`ChessToken.sol`**: ERC-20 token with faucet and batch-minting.
- **`ChessGame.sol`**: Game engine mirroring the Stacks logic (Elo, lifecycle, escrow).

### Base (Solidity)
- **`ChessToken.sol`**: ERC-20 token with faucet and batch-minting.
- **`ChessGame.sol`**: Game engine mirroring the Stacks logic (Elo, lifecycle, escrow).

### Off-chain Services
Chess itself is never validated on-chain — the contracts only escrow and settle.

- **Move relay** — Upstash Redis. Moves are turn-bound; capable wallets **cryptographically sign** each move (`canonicalMoveMessage` binds chain + game + ply + SAN + resulting position, so a signature can't be replayed onto another move).
- **Server verification** — the relay confirms the game is `Active` and enforces turn order via read-only chain calls (`onchain-read.ts`) before accepting a move.
- **Settlement (oracle)** — the server **oracle** replays the authoritative move list off-chain with chess.js (`settlement.ts`) and is the **only** address allowed to declare a winner/draw (`settleGame`, `onlyOracle`). It holds the same trust the relay already holds, is a rotatable low-value hot key (`setOracle`), and can only ever route funds to white / black / split. `reclaimExpired` is an oracle-independent backstop so escrow can never lock permanently.

## 🔥 Economic Model

### Layer 1 Gas (STX / CELO)
Used strictly for transaction fees. The protocol is designed to be "zero-risk" by isolating game wagers from the native gas tokens.

### Layer 2 Economy (CHESS Token)
A free-to-access in-game currency used for wagers, rewards, and ranking.
- **Faucet**: 1,000 CHESS per day per wallet.
- **Wagers**: Players agree on CHESS amounts (e.g., 100 CHESS) before starting.
- **Security**: Wagers are locked in the contract-owned vault (escrow) and released only upon game resolution.

## 🎮 Lifecycle Flow

1. **Connect**: Privy wallet (injected, embedded, or social) on Celo/Base, or Stacks Connect. Pick a chain via the chain-select modal.
2. **Initialization**: Player A picks a wager and creates a match (`createGame`). Tokens are escrowed in the contract.
3. **Matching**: Player B joins the match, locking an equal CHESS amount.
4. **Gameplay**: Moves go to the **relay** (not on-chain) — turn-bound and signed. The opponent's board syncs by polling. A side that doesn't move within the clock window forfeits on time.
5. **Resolution**: Checkmate/draw/timeout is replayed off-chain with chess.js, then **settled on-chain by the oracle** (`settleGame`); resign and accepted draws settle directly. `reclaimExpired` is the backstop if the oracle is down.
6. **Payout**: The contract releases the pot to the winner (or refunds both on a draw) and updates Elo ratings.

## 🔀 Migration Status — oracle settlement

The contract sources in `celo-contracts/` and `base-contracts/` have been upgraded to the **oracle model** (already live on the Celo-only [playchessify](https://github.com/jadonamite/playchessify) deployment: game `0xb378…`, minter token `0x3f7e…`). The EVM source mirrors that; the live Chessify deployments above still run the legacy `reportWin` player-model.

**Remaining to complete the multi-chain oracle migration (gated — touches live mainnet escrow):**

1. **Deploy** the new oracle `ChessGame` + minter `ChessToken` on Celo and Base; call `setOracle` / `setMinter`.
2. **Stacks**: author the Clarity equivalent of the oracle/minter model (the deployed Clarity contracts are still player-model — no Solidity port applies).
3. **Backend**: port `lib/celo-server.ts` → a per-chain server signer, plus the `api/games/[chain]/[id]/settle`, `api/cron/settle`, and `api/gas/sponsor` routes (gas sponsorship is Celo/MiniPay-specific and degrades to self-pay elsewhere).
4. **Frontend**: repoint `config/contracts.ts` + `config/abis.ts` at the new addresses/ABIs and switch resolution from `reportWin` to oracle-triggered `settleGame`.
5. **Operators**: fund + register the oracle, minter, and gas-sponsor keys per chain.

## 🧪 Testing

Uses Clarinet SDK + Vitest against a local simnet. Each test file is self-contained (`initBeforeEach: true` resets simnet per test).

```bash
npm run test          # run all tests
npm run test:report   # with coverage
npm run test:watch    # watch mode
```

| File | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `chess-token.test.ts` | SIP-010 transfer, faucet, mint, gateway-release guard |
| `registry.test.ts` | game creation, joining, player stat init |
| `logic.test.ts` | submit-move turn-flip, move-count, draw-clear |
| `escrow.test.ts` | wager locking, win payout, cancel refund, draw refund |
| `ranking.test.ts` | Elo formula (K=32, diff cap 400, floor 100, draws) |
| `timer.test.ts` | claim-timeout guards, can-claim, set-timeout-blocks |
| `router.test.ts` | resign, report-win, propose/accept draw, cancel lifecycle |

> **Note**: Legacy contract files (`router.clar`, `registry.clar`, etc.) remain in `contracts/` but are superseded. Only `chess-token-v3`, `chess-game`, and `automata-agent` are active on mainnet.
